# @nextclaw/agent-chat-ui

## 0.2.14

### Patch Changes

- Republish Nextclaw UI with upstream frontend dependency chain.

## 0.2.13

### Patch Changes

- f15df6a: Publish the pending NCP realtime sync batch together with the new built-in cross-channel messaging skill and Weixin self-notify route hints.

  This release keeps the product lightweight: the AI reuses the existing reply, `sessions_send`, and `message` primitives, and a fresh UI or NCP session can proactively notify the saved Weixin route without adding a separate notification abstraction.

## 0.2.12

### Patch Changes

- 1ce3d58: Improve chat stream rendering performance by preserving stable message identities for unchanged messages and batching sticky autoscroll work with requestAnimationFrame.

## 0.2.11

### Patch Changes

- Release the accumulated public workspace drift together with the Codex Responses contract fix. This batch includes the new stream-completion probe, the Codex runtime bundle entry alignment, and the already-unpublished package changes that the release guard requires to be versioned before publish.

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- Fix Codex CLI environment inheritance so the runtime keeps the host `PATH` and other base process variables when spawning command execution, and publish the plugin/runtime pair together for version alignment.

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- Publish the pending frontend UI batch together with the already-drifted public packages required by release guards.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- Make Claude engine and NCP runtime prompts bootstrap-aware so workspace context and requested skills are injected consistently, and refresh the shared chat UI tool/file cards to match the current tool lifecycle presentation.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Publish the current committed runtime and UI startup fixes as one aligned patch batch. This release moves the Codex runtime plugin onto host-injected agent runtime APIs, splits UI session reads from the deferred NCP runtime so `/api/ncp/sessions` is available before the runtime agent is ready, and republishes the linked public packages above the currently published tags so the shipped dependency chain stays version-consistent.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Publish the pending branch changes for Claude NCP event visibility and chat tool status feedback. Claude runtime now exposes richer reasoning and tool-call events to the NCP layer, and the shared chat UI surfaces clearer tool lifecycle states, call IDs, and output labels.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Ship the full set of current unreleased workspace package changes in one release batch, including the server/CLI updates already sitting in the working tree and the previously committed public package drift that has not been published yet. Republish the NCP agent runtime export surface so NextClaw can resolve `LocalAttachmentStore` after update, and add a release guard that blocks shipping public workspace dependents when a package has drifted past its published tag without a pending changeset.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- ee69ef6: Keep pasted and uploaded NCP images in composer order end to end: preserve caret placement, retain image visibility across follow-up turns without hidden model switching, and serialize mixed text/image message parts in the same order users authored them.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Add NCP image attachment support across the shared chat composer, NCP runtime, React bindings, and bundled NextClaw UI so pasted or uploaded images are sent as NCP file parts and rendered inline. Also keep the required CLI/server/mcp release group in sync for the bundled NextClaw distribution.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Republish all public workspace packages with pnpm publish guards so released manifests no longer retain workspace:\* dependencies and future npm publish misuse is blocked before release.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Release the tokenized chat composer, IME fixes, and inline skill chip UI improvements.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Unify the latest NCP native chat chain, runtime capability assembly, chat UI alignment, stream/reasoning/tool fixes, and marketplace metadata publishing into a single minor release.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cfcd97f: Split the reusable chat presentation layer into a standalone `@nextclaw/agent-chat-ui` package and wire `@nextclaw/ui` to consume it.
